You will find information on finding, compiling, installing and configuring web server software; on understanding the ins and outs of HTTP and HTML; on converting existing documents to HTML; on incorporating graphics, sound and video into your pages; on incorporating executable programs that run such features as searchable indexes, fill-out forms, clikable maps, and gateways to other services; and on writing server scripts to create dynamic documents. Lincoln D. Stein is Director of Informatics at the Whitehead Institute/ MIT Center for Genome Research, one of the world's most respected biomedical research sites. Dr. Stein set up the Institute's Web server, and this book was born of his experiences and frustrations in gathering the information necessary to accomplish this task.

From the Senate, the SATs, and sex to crime, celebrities, and cults, Paulos takes stories that may not seem to involve mathematics at all and demonstrates how mathematical naïveté can put readers at a distinct disadvantage.Whether he's using chaos theory to puncture economic and environmental predictions, applying logic and self-reference to clarify the hazards of spin doctoring and news compression, or employing arithmetic and common sense to give us a novel perspective on greed and relationships, Paulos never fails to entertain and enlighten.Even if you hated math in school, you'll love the numerical vignettes in this book."

Is being on-line truly useful? ""Few aspects of daily life require computers...They're irrelevant to cooking, driving, visiting, negotiating, eating, hiking, dancing, speaking, and gossiping. You don't need a computer to...recite a poem or say a prayer."" Computers can't, Stoll claims, provide a richer or better life. A cautionary tale about today's media darling, Silicon Snake Oil has sparked intense debate across the country about the merits--and foibles--of what's been touted as the entranceway to our future.
